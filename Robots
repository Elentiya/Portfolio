6/26 Today, we were working with circuits fo rthe first time and it was really fun. 
     Although, the wire was really finicky and it didn't want to work at times and at other times it did. I learned what the ground wire was 
     for. It is used to create a full loop of electricity. I was able to create a double wiring and light two LEDs and it was awesome!

<p> 6/28 Nothing was working properly. Not entirely sure why, but it won't. We tried everything: changing out wires, asking for help - from 
         several people, changed LED lights, everything. We finally determined that it was due to the fact that the batteries do not want to 
         work properly, and need to replace them. We were able to get one light to glow, but the other has a faint glow, and that's as far
         as we got to finishing this robot.
