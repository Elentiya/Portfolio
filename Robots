6/26 Today, we were working with circuits fo rthe first time and it was really fun. 
     Although, the wire was really finicky and it didn't want to work at times and at other times it did. I learned what the ground wire was 
     for. It is used to create a full loop of electricity. I was able to create a double wiring and light two LEDs and it was awesome!

<p> 6/28 Nothing was working properly. Not entirely sure why, but it won't. We tried everything: changing out wires, asking for help - from 
         several people
