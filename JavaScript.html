7/5 The internet works when a user requests a site, it sends a signal to the router to take it to the directed DNS (Domain Name System) 
where the web address is translated into an IP address. Then it takes the packets to a satellite where it is rearranged and sent back 
to the router and sent to the computer where the website is then pixalated.
